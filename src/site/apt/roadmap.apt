	- General comment

* {2011/2012 1.1.0}

	Brainstorming:

	! additional Object-resolver with digester (Use a digester-Rules-XML to convert a XML to an Object)

	! additional Object-resolver with Spring (Use one or more springContext-XML to convert a XML to an Object)

	! additional Content-resolver with VFSPath?

	! additional Connector to Windows registry:

		* {{http://www.trustice.com/java/jnireg/}}

	! additional Connector to Preferences?:
	
		* {{http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.4.2/docs/api/java/util/prefs/Preferences.html}}
	
		* {{http://www.particle.kth.se/~lindsey/JavaCourse/Book/Part1/Java/Chapter10/Preferences.html}}


* {2011 Final Version 1.0.0 - after few bug fixes}



* {2011 1.0.0-rc - refactored release}

    - extended JavaDoc and UnitTests

	! additional Connector to Environment Variables.
  
* {2011 1.0.0-beta3 - refactored release}

	- Remove Setter. (The core-feature of settings4j is to GET Settings, the implementation is now much simpler.)

	! Additional Helper for the Springframework. see JavaDoc of org.settings4j.helper.spring.Settings4jFactoryBean.java
  
* {2009 1.0.0-beta2 - refactored release}

	- Remove Hirachical Structure. (it works, but without it, the usage is much simpler.)

	- Change of the Settings interface: setXXX(key, value) to: setXXX(key, value, connectorName);
	
	- Add Filter to Connectors, ContentResolver and ObjectResolvers

	- Add additional method: getConnectors() returns all Connectors
	
	- Add additional method: getConnector(ConnectorName) return the Connector for the given Name.

* {6. July 2008 1.0.0-beta - release with additional features:}

    ! Object-Resolver implementations with java.beans.XMLEncoder and XMLDecoder

    ! Object-Resolver implementations with {{{http://springframework.org/}Springframework}} (readonly, an object can only be set with setContent)

    ! A DB-Connector implemented with Hibernate, configurable with Settings4j over SystemProperties or JNDI-Envirenment-Variables.

    ! settings4j.xml: addictive="false" if no heredity of connectors are being requested.

    ! settings4j.xml: cached="true" A Wrapper for Settings, Connectors and ObjectResolvers to cache all requests.

    - Extend the Example-App to configure a DB-Connector. The {{{http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.4.2/docs/api/javax/sql/DataSource.html}DataSource}}-Object comes from JNDI-Context or with an ObjectResolver from FileSystemConnector.

    ! mappings configured in settings4j.xml: map one key to an other Key.


* {12. May 2008 1.0.0-alpha - release with following features:}

    ! Automatically read settings4j.xml from classpath if available

    ! Simple Default fall back Configuration if no settings4j.xml is found.

    ! Hirachical Structure in settings4j.xml like log4j

    ! Main Connector-Implementations: for SystemProperties, Classpath, JNDI-Context, PropertyFile

    - A Simple Example Module who can be use by a Commandline-Client or a web application. The module is configurable either with SystemProperties or JNDI-Envirenment-Variables depends on the settings4j.xml inside the two Client-Applications (jar or war)

* {6. July 2008 1.0.0-beta - release with additional features:}

    ! Object-Resolver implementations with java.beans.XMLEncoder and XMLDecoder

    ! Object-Resolver implementations with {{{http://springframework.org/}Springframework}} (readonly, an object can only be set with setContent)

    ! A DB-Connector implemented with Hibernate, configurable with Settings4j over SystemProperties or JNDI-Envirenment-Variables.

    ! settings4j.xml: addictive="false" if no heredity of connectors are being requested.

    ! settings4j.xml: cached="true" A Wrapper for Settings, Connectors and ObjectResolvers to cache all requests.

    - Extend the Example-App to configure a DB-Connector. The {{{http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.4.2/docs/api/javax/sql/DataSource.html}DataSource}}-Object comes from JNDI-Context or with an ObjectResolver from FileSystemConnector.

    ! mappings configured in settings4j.xml: map one key to an other Key.


* {12. May 2008 1.0.0-alpha - release with following features:}

    ! Automatically read settings4j.xml from classpath if available

    ! Simple Default fall back Configuration if no settings4j.xml is found.

    ! Hirachical Structure in settings4j.xml like log4j

    ! Main Connector-Implementations: for SystemProperties, Classpath, JNDI-Context, PropertyFile

    - A Simple Example Module who can be use by a Commandline-Client or a web application. The module is configurable either with SystemProperties or JNDI-Envirenment-Variables depends on the settings4j.xml inside the two Client-Applications (jar or war)
